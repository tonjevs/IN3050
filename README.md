# IN3050 - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## About the Repo

This course provides a fundamental introduction to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). With an algorithmic approach, students gain practical understanding of the methods covered, including hands-on implementation of several of these methods. The course encompasses supervised classification based on artificial neural networks (deep learning), as well as unsupervised learning (cluster analysis), regression, optimization (evolutionary algorithms and other search methods), reinforcement learning, as well as experiment design and evaluation. Students are also introduced to philosophical foundational issues and ethical questions related to ML/AI, along with the history of the field.

## What You'll Learn

- Have insight into key methods used in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).
- Possess knowledge of the historical development of the field.
- Be capable of designing and conducting experiments using these methods, with a focus on evaluation.
- Be able to assess the advantages and disadvantages of selecting ML/AI methods for various applications.
- Be capable of implementing algorithms for selected methods.
- Have awareness of fundamental philosophical and ethical questions related to the development and application of ML/AI.
